Los Angeles is a hilly place - incidents of crime have been recorded along with the elevation at the crime scene. Can you identify patterns of crime?

Using ag-Grid try find patterns here - are there more crimes higher up where the wealthy live, or down below?

There are 3 skeleton projects included - one for each of the following language/frameworks:

- JavaScript
- Angular 1
- Angular 2

With all three, you can get started by navigating to the relevant directory, then running the following:
```
- npm install
- npm start
```

Getting Start Documentation for using the above with ag-Grid can be found here:

- [ag-Grid with JavaScript](https://www.ag-grid.com/best-javascript-data-grid)
- [ag-Grid with Angular 1](https://www.ag-grid.com/best-angularjs-data-grid)
- [ag-Grid with Angular 2](https://www.ag-grid.com/best-angular-2-data-grid)

You're free to use any library you'd like, and come up with anything you like, as long as you use ag-Grid to display/contain the main results.

Some ideas work experimenting with in the grid are:

- [Sorting](https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-sorting)
- [Filtering](https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-filtering)
- [Grouping Rows](https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-grouping)
- [Pivoting](https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-pivoting)
- [Aggregation](https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-aggregation)
- [Rendering](https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-cell-rendering)
- [Styling](https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-cell-styling)
